# Task Arithmetic Under Bias-Variance Trade-off

### Main goals

- To investigate the relationship between the change in the amount of Information
in the Weights (measured indirectly via log Tr[Fˆ
θ]) during the fine-tuning stage of
pre-trained models and the empirical success of the composition of task vectors τ to
achieve multi-task capabilities.

 - How the Task Addition operations (namely, scaling task vectors τ by α and the summation of scaled task vectors with the pre-trained weights θ0 + α
P
t
τt) modulate
such Information in the Weights.
