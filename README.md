# Task Arithmetic Under Bias-Variance Trade-off

### Main goals

> To investigate the relationship between the change in the amount of Information
> in the Weights during the fine-tuning stage of
> pre-trained models and the empirical success of the composition of task vectors Ï„ to
> achieve multi-task capabilities.

> How the Task Addition operations modulate
> such Information in the Weights.
